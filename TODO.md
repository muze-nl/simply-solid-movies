# TODO

- add a movie poster image to the suggested movie
- add a 'show me another movie' button, which selects a different random movie from the list of movies you haven't seen yet
- allow the user to load other movie databases, from other users and then
  - merge the movie databases
  - select a movie in common in all databases, which most users haven't seen yet
    (note: the Store() class makes it easy to merge databases, simply add more quads)
